# Getting Started

The goal of Warlock is to create a generic, flexible build system that can support any kind of
structure or process.

---

Warlock should use a "convention over configuration" philosophy to encourage best practices and to
save developers time. In many ways, Warlock is like Grunt, Gulp, and Yeoman - but on steroids.

Warlock is in the **very** early stages of development, but if you're interested in learning more or
taking it for a spin, check out the [Tutorial](https://github.com/ngbp/warlock/blob/master/docs/guides/tutorial.md).

Warlock is based, in part, on work done for [ngbp](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp).
